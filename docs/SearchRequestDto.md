For example, if you search \&quot;Google Pixel 5\&quot; without query expansion, you might only get \&quot;google_pixel_5\&quot; in the result. With query expansion, you might get \&quot;google_pixel_4a_with_5g\&quot;, \&quot;google_pixel_4a\&quot; and \&quot;google_pixel_5_case\&quot; as well.The default value is configured in the tenant settings or true if there is no such setting | [optional]
